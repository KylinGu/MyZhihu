# MyZhihu
Another **Zhihu Daily app**, it is an MVP practice, and it's my first network type app, 
I will do more efforts on it. If you have good suggesstions, please let me.       
I use Activity as view, and design a corresponding view interface and presenter for it.  
The view interface will make me interface-oriented program and decouple the view, model, controller.  

Model is various bean, which is used to represent a response of a request.  
All the model is updated or assigned values by Volley Network framework.  
It is a very easy-used and friendly library.
