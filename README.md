# MyZhihu
Another Zhihu Daily app, it is an MVP practice, and it's my first network type app, 
I will do more efforts on it.    
I use Activity as view, and design a corresponding view interface and presenter for it.  
The view interface will make me interface-oriented program and decouple the view, model, controller.  

Model is various bean, which is used to represent a response of a request.  
All the model is updated or assigned values by Volley Network framework.  
It is a very easy-used and friendly library.  

## ToDo
There's a lot of things to do.
# 1. Abstract a base view interface

# 2. Add top stories gallery.

# 3. ReImplemention the detail story.

# 4. Using Dagger2 to find view.

# 5. Design a abstract presenter using Generic Type.

# 6. Settings.

# 7. pull up to loading previous stories.
